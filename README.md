# Greg's BlackJack project
This is a classic game of BlackJack.
The player will be dealt two cards.
If they get BlackJack(21) they win
The dealer will be dealt two cards(one face up one face down).
If the dealer gets BlackJack he wins.
Player will be asked if the would like to Hit or Stay.
If the player chooses Hit and their total goes over 21 they
are busted and they lose.
Once the player is satisfied with their score the dealer will
reveal his second card.
If the dealers total is 16 or lower he will hit, if it is 17
or above he will stay.  
If the dealer hits and exceeds 21 he will be busted and player wins.
If the dealer ends with a score lower than the player the player
wins.  If the dealers score is higher the player loses.
If the scores are the same the game ends in a push with neither
player winning.  Once the game is over the player is asked if they
would like to play again.
